<h5>
There`s no one more dangerous than a common man on a death wish. 
This is one such story of a man remorselessly wronged by the establishment. 
One freak incident results in everything he held dear taken away from him. Predictably, 
this system doesn`t seem to care - let alone resolve. 
That`s when Ajay (AK) takes matters in his own hands. 
An underground vigilante army, a secret id
an elaborate modus...all of these combined make a `Gabbar` - a true hero with dreadful villainous instincts.
